# AlbumList

The app is created using React and have below features:

1. Fetch and show albums from the api - https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums
2. Add an album, make a POST call to the above url (from where you are fetching) and save the album in react state. (This will be a dummy request, you wonâ€™t be able to add albums to the server. But the request is valid and will send you some data.
3. Update the album, make a PUT call to the above url. (Again this is a dummy call).
4. Delete an album, make a DELETE call to the above url. (Again this is a dummy call).
